    <string name="about">\nMergeBalls is a fun and simple game for the Android platform. There are 3 difficulty settings and
    20 levels per difficulty. Playing the higher levels might need a more powerful phone due to the amount of objects to be rendered on screen.
    \n\nStart by filling in your name and choose your settings in the Preferences menu. Playing the game itself is easy. Try to encircle
    balls of the same color to merge them into larger balls. When all balls of the same color have been merged you have beat the level. A shorter time is better
    which means that the lowest score is the best. There are both local and online hi-scores, so have fun!\n</string>
